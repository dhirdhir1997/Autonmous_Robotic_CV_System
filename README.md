# Autonmous_Robotic_CV_System
A computer vision based robotic system using Jackal UGV

Create a vision system for autonomous operation - Machine vision integrated with a ground robot

Software development: 
a. Design of a simulation environment
b.Integration of machine vision (SLAM & object
recognition/scene segmentation)
c. Design of feedback and motion planning strategies
